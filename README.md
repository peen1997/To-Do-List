To run all this project:
  $npm run dev
To run only server-side development and I found some errors when I run $npm run server, so it works if you click :
  $nodemon server.js
And, it will initialize React app in port 3000 independently with server-side
   $npm run client 
Finally, I still works with registration and authentication and complete it soon
